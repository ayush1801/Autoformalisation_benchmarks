/--`theorem`
Power Set is Closed under Intersection
Let $S$ be a set.

Let $\powerset S$ be the power set of $S$.


Then:
:$\forall A, B \in \powerset S: A \cap B \in \powerset S$
`proof`
Let $A, B \in \powerset S$.

Then by the definition of power set, $A \subseteq S$ and $B \subseteq S$.

From Intersection is Subset we have that $A \cap B \subseteq A$.

It follows from Subset Relation is Transitive that $A \cap B \subseteq S$.

Thus $A \cap B \in \powerset S$ and closure is proved.

Square of Sum
 :$\forall x, y \in \R: \paren {x + y}^2 = x^2 + 2 x y + y^2$
`proof`
Follows from the distribution of multiplication over addition:

{{eqn | l = \left({x + y}\right)^2
      | r = \left({x + y}\right) \cdot \left({x + y}\right)
}}

      | c = Real Multiplication Distributes over Addition
}}
{{eqn | r = x \cdot x + x \cdot y + y \cdot x + y \cdot y
      | c = Real Multiplication Distributes over Addition
}}
{{eqn | r = x^2 + 2xy + y^2
      | c =

/--`theorem`
Identity of Group is Unique
Let $\struct {G, \circ}$ be a group. Then there is a unique identity element $e \in G$.
`proof`
From Group has Latin Square Property, there exists a unique $x \in G$ such that:
:$a x = b$

and there exists a unique $y \in G$ such that:
:$y a = b$

Setting $b = a$, this becomes:

There exists a unique $x \in G$ such that:
:$a x = a$

and there exists a unique $y \in G$ such that:
:$y a = a$

These $x$ and $y$ are both $e$, by definition of identity element.

/--`theorem`
Bernoulli polynomial evaluation
Given a natural number $n$ and a rational $x$, let $B_n (x)$ denote the $n$-th Bernoulli polynomial evaluated at $x$. Then, $$B_n (1 + x) = B_n (x) + n x^{n - 1}$$
`proof`
We apply strong induction on $n$. So, for all $m < d$, we have $B_{m} (1 + x) = B_{m} (x) + m x^{m - 1}$ and we want to show that $$B_{d} (1 + x) = B_{d} (x) + d x^{d - 1}$$
Multiplying both sides by $d + 1$, and using the fact that, for all $l \in \mathbb{N}$, $\sum_{k = 0}^{l} {l + 1 \choose k} B_k = (l + 1) X^l$ (where $B_k$ is the $k$-th Bernoulli number), we get that 
$$ (d + 1) (1 + x)^d - (d + 1) x^d = \sum_{l = 0}^{d} {d + 1 \choose l} l x^{l - 1} $$
The conclusion then follows easily.

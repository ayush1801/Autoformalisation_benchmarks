Power Set is Closed under Intersection
Let $S$ be a set.

Let $\powerset S$ be the power set of $S$.


Then:
:$\forall A, B \in \powerset S: A \cap B \in \powerset S$
`proof`
Let $A, B \in \powerset S$.

Then by the definition of power set, $A \subseteq S$ and $B \subseteq S$.

From Intersection is Subset we have that $A \cap B \subseteq A$.

It follows from Subset Relation is Transitive that $A \cap B \subseteq S$.

Thus $A \cap B \in \powerset S$ and closure is proved.

Identity of Group is Unique
Let $\struct {G, \circ}$ be a group. Then there is a unique identity element $e \in G$.
`proof`
From Group has Latin Square Property, there exists a unique $x \in G$ such that:
:$a x = b$

and there exists a unique $y \in G$ such that:
:$y a = b$

Setting $b = a$, this becomes:

There exists a unique $x \in G$ such that:
:$a x = a$

and there exists a unique $y \in G$ such that:
:$y a = a$

These $x$ and $y$ are both $e$, by definition of identity element.

/--`theorem`
p-adic units
Given a prime number $p$ and a natural number $x$, if $x$ is coprime to $p$, then $x$ is a unit in the $p$-adic integers.
`proof`
Let us prove the contrapositive, that is, is $x$ is not a unit of $\mathbb{Z}_p$, then $x$ is not coprime to $p$. 
We know that any element of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is a unit if and only if it has norm 1, thus $\Vert x \Vert \neq 1$. Also, since every element of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ must have norm less than or equal to 1, we conclude that $\Vert x \Vert < 1$. 
But this must imply that $p | x$.
This completes our proof.

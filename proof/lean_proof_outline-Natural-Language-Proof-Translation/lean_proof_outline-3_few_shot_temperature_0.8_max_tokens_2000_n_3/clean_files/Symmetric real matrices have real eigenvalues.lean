Power Set is Closed under Intersection
Let $S$ be a set.

Let $\powerset S$ be the power set of $S$.


Then:
:$\forall A, B \in \powerset S: A \cap B \in \powerset S$
`proof`
Let $A, B \in \powerset S$.

Then by the definition of power set, $A \subseteq S$ and $B \subseteq S$.

From Intersection is Subset we have that $A \cap B \subseteq A$.

It follows from Subset Relation is Transitive that $A \cap B \subseteq S$.

Thus $A \cap B \in \powerset S$ and closure is proved.

Identity of Group is Unique
Let $\struct {G, \circ}$ be a group. Then there is a unique identity element $e \in G$.
`proof`
From Group has Latin Square Property, there exists a unique $x \in G$ such that:
:$a x = b$

and there exists a unique $y \in G$ such that:
:$y a = b$

Setting $b = a$, this becomes:

There exists a unique $x \in G$ such that:
:$a x = a$

and there exists a unique $y \in G$ such that:
:$y a = a$

These $x$ and $y$ are both $e$, by definition of identity element.

/--`theorem`
Symmetric real matrices have real eigenvalues
Every real symmetric matrix has real eigenvalues.
`proof`
Recall that if $z=a+b i$ is a complex number, its complex conjugate is defined by $\bar{z}=a-b i$. We have $z \bar{z}=(a+b i)(a-b i)=a^{2}+b^{2}$, so $z \bar{z}$ is always a nonnegative real number (and equals 0 only when $z=0$ ). It is also true that if $w, z$ are complex numbers, then $\overline{w z}=\bar{w} \bar{z}$.

With this in mind, suppose that $\lambda$ is a (possibly complex) eigenvalue of the real symmetric matrix $A$. Thus there is a nonzero vector $\mathbf{v}$, also with complex entries, such that $A \mathbf{v}=\lambda \mathbf{v}$. By taking the complex conjugate of both sides, and noting that $\bar{A}=A$ since $A$ has real entries, we get $\overline{A \mathbf{v}}=\overline{\lambda \mathbf{v}} \Rightarrow A \overline{\mathbf{v}}=\bar{\lambda} \overline{\mathbf{v}}$. Then, using that $A^{T}=A$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\overline{\mathbf{v}}^{T} A \mathbf{v}=\overline{\mathbf{v}}^{T}(A \mathbf{v})=\overline{\mathbf{v}}^{T}(\lambda \mathbf{v})=\lambda(\overline{\mathbf{v}} \cdot \mathbf{v}) \\
&\overline{\mathbf{v}}^{T} A \mathbf{v}=(A \overline{\mathbf{v}})^{T} \mathbf{v}=(\bar{\lambda} \overline{\mathbf{v}})^{T} \mathbf{v}=\bar{\lambda}(\overline{\mathbf{v}} \cdot \mathbf{v}) .
\end{aligned}
$$

Since $\mathbf{v} \neq \mathbf{0}$, we have $\overline{\mathbf{v}} \cdot \mathbf{v} \neq 0$. Thus $\lambda=\bar{\lambda}$, which means $\lambda \in \mathbf{R}$

/--`theorem`
Two lines intersect
Two different lines intersect at some point.
`proof`
Let $l_{1}$ and $l_{2}$ be two different lines in the plane. We prove that every pair of points $(a,b)$ and $(c,d)$ which do not lie on the same vertical line can be connected by a line segment.
Let $S=\left\{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^{2} : y=mx(x-a)+n(x-a)+b\right\}$, where $m=\frac{d-b}{c-a}$ and $n=\frac{c b-a d}{c-a}$.
If $a=0$, then $n=b$ and $S=\left\{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^{2} : y=mx+b\right\}$, which is identical to our definition of line. If $a \neq 0$, then $S \cap \left\{0\right\} \times \mathbb{R}=\left\{(0,b)\right\}$.
Now let $T=\mathbb{R} \times \left\{a,b,c,d\right\}$.
If $(a,b)=(c,d)$, then $T=\left\{(a,b)\right\}$. If $(a,b) \neq (c,d)$, then $T \cap \left\{0\right\} \times \mathbb{R}=\left\{(0,b)\right\}$ and $T \cap \left\{c\right\} \times \mathbb{R}=\left\{(c,d)\right\}$.
Let $p:T \rightarrow S$ be the function $p(x,y)=(x,mx x+nx+b)$. We will prove that $p$ is one-to-one, onto, and continuous.
If $x_{1}=x_{2}$, then $p(x_{1},y_{1})=p(x_{2},y_{2})$. If $y_{1}=y_{2}$, then $p(x_{1},y_{1})=p(x_{2},y_{2})$. If $x_{1} \neq x_{2}$ and $y_{1} \neq y_{2}$, then $p(x_{1},y_{1}) \neq p(x_{2},y_{2})$. So, $p$ is one-to-one.
To prove that $p$ is onto, we note that if $c=d$, then $\left\{0\right\} \times \mathbb{R} \subset T$ and $p(\left\{0\right\} \times \mathbb{R}) \subset S$. If $c \neq d$, then, using the intermediate value theorem, for all $y \in \mathbb{R}$, there is an $x \in \mathbb{R}$ such that
$$
y=\frac{d-b}{c-a}x+\frac{c b-a d}{c-a}x+b=mx x+nx+b,
$$
therefore $S \subset p(T)$. Thus, $p$ is onto.
To prove that $p$ is continuous, we note that if $c=d$, then $p$ is constant, and so is continuous. If $c \neq d$, then
$$
\lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow(c,d)} p(x,y)=\lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow(c,d)}(x,mx x+nx+b)=\lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow(c,d)}\left(x,\frac{d-b}{c-a}x+\frac{c b-a d}{c-a}x+b\right)=(c,d).
$$
So, $p$ is continuous. Therefore, $T$ and $S$ are homeomorphic.
Now, to show that every pair points $(a,b),(c,d)$ which do not lie on the same vertical line can be connected by a line segment, we will show that $T$ is connected, which is sufficient since homeomorphic spaces are connected iff one of them is. If $a>c$ or $a<c$, then $T \cap \left\{0\right\} \times \mathbb{R}=\left\{(0,b)\right\}$ and $T \cap \left\{c\right\} \times \mathbb{R}=\left\{(c,d)\right\}$, so $T$ is disconnected. If $a=c$, then $T \cap \left\{0\right\} \times \mathbb{R}=\left\{(0,b),(0,d)\right\}$ or $T \cap \left\{0\right\} \times \mathbb{R}=\left\{(0,b),(0,d)\right\}$, so $T$ is connected.

/--`theorem`
Peano Axioms are Consistent
The Peano Axioms are consistent.
`proof`
Let $P, Q, R$ denote the following statements:

:$P$ $ \equiv \forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \nexists k \in \mathbb{N} (n = k+1)$

:$Q$ $ \equiv \forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \forall m \in \mathbb{N} (n+1 = m+1) \rightarrow n = m$

:$R$ $ \equiv \forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \forall m \in \mathbb{N} (n+1 = m+1) \rightarrow n = m$

Assume the Peano Axioms are inconsistent. Then there exists a natural number $n$ such that both $P(n)$ and $
\neg P(n)$ hold. That is, there exists a natural number $n$ such that $n$ is not the successor of a natural number and $n$ is the successor of a natural number. Let $n$ denote the largest natural number with this property.

We have that $P(n+1)$ holds, since by definition $n+1$ is not the successor of a natural number. But $\neg P(n)$ holds, so that $n$ is the successor of a natural number. Thus there exists a unique natural number $k$ such that $n = k+1$.

Now, consider $Q(n,n)$ and $R(n,n+1)$. $Q(n,n)$ holds, since $n+1 = n+1$ and $n = n$. $R(n,n+1)$ does not hold, since $n+1 = n+2$ and $n \neq n+1$. Thus both $\neg Q(n,n)$ and $R(n,n+1)$ hold. This is a contradiction. Thus the Peano Axioms are consistent.

Arboreal optimization theorem
The arboreal optimization theorem states that a binary tree with n  nodes (n  ≥  0) internal nodes can be augmented to a binary tree with n  +  1 internal nodes in which the following holds. Every path from the root to a leaf node in the augmented binary tree has the same number of left branches as right branches.
`proof`
We prove that the result is true for n  +  1 by induction on n . When n  =  0, the result is true by the axiom of specification. Assume that the theorem is true for n . Now, consider a binary tree with n + 1 internal nodes. If the tree has two subtrees of equal height, then we can add one more node to the binary tree to get a binary tree with n + 2 internal nodes, in which every path from the root to a leaf node has the same number of left branches as right branches. If the binary tree has two subtrees of unequal height, we can add one more node to the binary tree to get a binary tree with n + 2 internal nodes, in which every path from the root to a leaf node has the same number of left branches as right branches.

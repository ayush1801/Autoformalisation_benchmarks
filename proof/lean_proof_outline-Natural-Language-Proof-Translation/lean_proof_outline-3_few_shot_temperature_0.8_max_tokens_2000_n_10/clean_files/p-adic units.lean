Galois' Conjugates
Given a prime number $p$ and a natural number $x$, let $y$ be a $p$-adic conjugate of $x$, that is, $y \equiv x \pmod {p^2}$. Then $y$ is a unit.
`proof`
We prove the contrapositive, that is, if $y$ is not a unit, then $p | y$. 
We know that $y \equiv x \pmod {p^2}$. Also, we have that $y \equiv 0 \pmod p$, as this is true for all $p$-adic conjugates. 
Thus, $p | y$.
This completes the proof.

/--`theorem`
Finite Cardinality Characteristic
Let $\struct {G, \circ}$ be a group. Then the number of elements of $G$ is either finite or countably infinite.
`proof`
The proof is by induction on the number of elements of $G$. The base case is when $G$ has no elements.
In this case, $G$ is empty, so the number of elements of $G$ is finite.

Now assume that the result holds for all groups with $n$ elements, for all natural numbers $n$ no bigger than some fixed $k$, and assume that $G$ has $k+1$ elements. Let $x$ be one of the $k+1$ elements of $G$.

We claim that $G$ is the disjoint union of the following sets:
:$S_1 = \set{e}$
:$S_2 = \set{x}$
:$S_3 = \set{a : a \in G, a \neq e, a \neq x}$
:$S_4 = \set{a \circ x^{-1} : a \in G}$

To show that $G$ is the disjoint union of $S_1, S_2, S_3,$ and $S_4$, we must show that the following are true:
:$G = S_1 \cup S_2 \cup S_3 \cup S_4$
:$S_1 \cap S_2 = \emptyset$
:$S_1 \cap S_3 = \emptyset$
:$S_1 \cap S_4 = \emptyset$
:$S_2 \cap S_3 = \emptyset$
:$S_2 \cap S_4 = \emptyset$
:$S_3 \cap S_4 = \emptyset$

First, $G = S_1 \cup S_2 \cup S_3 \cup S_4$.
This is true because the members of $S_1$, $S_2$, $S_3$, and $S_4$ are all elements of $G$.

Second, $S_1 \cap S_2 = \emptyset$.
This is true because $S_1$ and $S_2$ are both singleton sets, so they can only intersect if they have the same element, but $x \neq e$.

Third, $S_1 \cap S_3 = \emptyset$.
This is true because $G$ is a group, so the identity element is unique.

Fourth, $S_1 \cap S_4 = \emptyset$.
This is true because $S_4$ does not contain $e$ or $x$.

Fifth, $S_2 \cap S_3 = \emptyset$.
This is true because $S_2$ and $S_3$ are disjoint by construction.

Sixth, $S_2 \cap S_4 = \emptyset$.
This is true because $S_2$ contains $x$, and there is no element $a$ such that $a \circ x^{-1} = x$.

Last, $S_3 \cap S_4 = \emptyset$.
This is true because $S_3$ does not contain $x$ and $S_4$ does not contain $e$.

The sets $S_1$, $S_2$, and $S_3$ are all finite, so we need only show that $S_4$ is finite.

Because $S_4$ is the set of all elements of $G$ that are conjugates of $x$, its cardinality is the number of conjugates of $x$.

Suppose that $x$ has $k$ conjugates. Then the number of elements of $G$ is the sum of $k$, 1, and $k$, which is $k + 1 + k = 2k + 1$, so the number of elements of $G$ is finite.

We conclude that if $G$ has $2k+1$ elements, it cannot have $k+1$ conjugates, so $G$ has no more than $k$ conjugates.

Assume that $G$ has $k+1$ conjugates. Then $G$ has $2k+1$ elements, because of the above argument. 
This contradicts the induction hypothesis, which states that a group with $2k+1$ elements must have $k$ or fewer conjugates, so $G$ must have $k$ or fewer conjugates.

Because $G$ has $k$ or fewer conjugates, the number of elements of $G$ is either $2k+1$ or less than $2k+1$.

We conclude that if $G$ has $k+1$ elements, it cannot have $k+1$ conjugates, so $G$ has either $k$ elements or fewer, or $2k+1$ elements or less.

We conclude that if $G$ has $k+1$ elements, it has either $k$ or fewer elements, or it has $2k+1$ or fewer elements.

Power Set is Closed under Intersection
Let $S$ be a set.

Let $\powerset S$ be the power set of $S$.


Then:
:$\forall A, B \in \powerset S: A \cap B \in \powerset S$
`proof`
Let $A, B \in \powerset S$.

Then by the definition of power set, $A \subseteq S$ and $B \subseteq S$.

From Intersection is Subset we have that $A \cap B \subseteq A$.

It follows from Subset Relation is Transitive that $A \cap B \subseteq S$.

Thus $A \cap B \in \powerset S$ and closure is proved.

Identity of Group is Unique
Let $\struct {G, \circ}$ be a group. Then there is a unique identity element $e \in G$.
`proof`
From Group has Latin Square Property, there exists a unique $x \in G$ such that:
:$a x = b$

and there exists a unique $y \in G$ such that:
:$y a = b$

Setting $b = a$, this becomes:

There exists a unique $x \in G$ such that:
:$a x = a$

and there exists a unique $y \in G$ such that:
:$y a = a$

These $x$ and $y$ are both $e$, by definition of identity element.

p-adic units
Given a prime number $p$ and a natural number $x$, if $x$ is coprime to $p$, then $x$ is a unit in the $p$-adic integers.
`proof`
Let us prove the contrapositive, that is, is $x$ is not a unit of $\mathbb{Z}_p$, then $x$ is not coprime to $p$. 
We know that any element of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is a unit if and only if it has norm 1, thus $\Vert x \Vert \neq 1$. Also, since every element of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ must have norm less than or equal to 1, we conclude that $\Vert x \Vert < 1$. 
But this must imply that $p | x$.
This completes our proof.

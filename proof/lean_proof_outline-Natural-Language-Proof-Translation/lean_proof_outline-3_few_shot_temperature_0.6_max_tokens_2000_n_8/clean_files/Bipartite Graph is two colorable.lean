/--`theorem`
If two graphs are isomorphic, then they are bipartite if and only if they are two colorable
Let $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$ be two isomorphic graphs. Then $G_{1}$ is 2-colorable if and only if $G_{2}$ is 2-colorable and $G_{1}$ is bipartite if and only if $G_{2}$ is bipartite.
`proof`
Let $f$ be an isomorphism from $G_{1}$ to $G_{2}$.

Suppose $G_{1}$ is 2-colorable. We can color every vertex either red or blue, and no edge will have both endpoints colored the same color. Let $A$ denote the subset of vertices colored red, and let $B$ denote the subset of vertices colored blue. Since all vertices of $A$ are red, there are no edges within $A$, and similarly for $B$. This implies that every edge has one endpoint in $A$ and the other in $B$, which means $G_{1}$ is bipartite.

Now suppose $G_{2}$ is 2-colorable. We can color every vertex either red or blue, and no edge will have both endpoints colored the same color. Let $A$ denote the subset of vertices colored red, and let $B$ denote the subset of vertices colored blue. Since all vertices of $A$ are red, there are no edges within $A$, and similarly for $B$. This implies that every edge has one endpoint in $A$ and the other in $B$, which means $G_{2}$ is bipartite.

By the definition of isomorphism, we know that $f(A) = A$ and $f(B) = B$. This means that the vertices of $G_{1}$ colored red are the same vertices of $G_{2}$ colored red, and the vertices of $G_{1}$ colored blue are the same vertices of $G_{2}$ colored blue. Since the vertices of $A$ and $B$ have no edges among themselves, and all edges have one endpoint in $A$ and the other in $B$, it follows that $G_{1}$ is bipartite.

Conversely, suppose $G_{1}$ is bipartite, that is, we can partition the vertices into two subsets $V_{1}, V_{2}$ every edge has one endpoint in $V_{1}$ and the other in $V_{2}$. Then coloring every vertex of $V_{1}$ red and every vertex of $V_{2}$ blue yields a valid coloring, so $G_{1}$ is 2-colorable.

Now suppose $G_{2}$ is bipartite, that is, we can partition the vertices into two subsets $V_{1}, V_{2}$ every edge has one endpoint in $V_{1}$ and the other in $V_{2}$. Then coloring every vertex of $V_{1}$ red and every vertex of $V_{2}$ blue yields a valid coloring, so $G_{2}$ is 2-colorable.

By the definition of isomorphism, we know that $f(V_{1}) = V_{1}$ and $f(V_{2}) = V_{2}$. This means that the vertices of $G_{1}$ colored red are the same vertices of $G_{2}$ colored red, and the vertices of $G_{1}$ colored blue are the same vertices of $G_{2}$ colored blue. Since the vertices of $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$ have no edges among themselves, and all edges have one endpoint in $V_{1}$ and the other in $V_{2}$, it follows that $G_{1}$ is bipartite.

Power Set is Closed under Intersection
Let $S$ be a set.

Let $\powerset S$ be the power set of $S$.


Then:
:$\forall A, B \in \powerset S: A \cap B \in \powerset S$
`proof`
Let $A, B \in \powerset S$.

Then by the definition of power set, $A \subseteq S$ and $B \subseteq S$.

From Intersection is Subset we have that $A \cap B \subseteq A$.

It follows from Subset Relation is Transitive that $A \cap B \subseteq S$.

Thus $A \cap B \in \powerset S$ and closure is proved.

Identity of Group is Unique
Let $\struct {G, \circ}$ be a group. Then there is a unique identity element $e \in G$.
`proof`
From Group has Latin Square Property, there exists a unique $x \in G$ such that:
:$a x = b$

and there exists a unique $y \in G$ such that:
:$y a = b$

Setting $b = a$, this becomes:

There exists a unique $x \in G$ such that:
:$a x = a$

and there exists a unique $y \in G$ such that:
:$y a = a$

These $x$ and $y$ are both $e$, by definition of identity element.

Bipartite Graph is two colorable
Let $G$ be a graph. Then $G$ is 2-colorable if and only if $G$ is bipartite.
`proof`
Let $G$ be a 2-colorable graph, which means we can color every vertex either red or blue, and no edge will have both endpoints colored the same color. Let $A$ denote the subset of vertices colored red, and let $B$ denote the subset of vertices colored blue. Since all vertices of $A$ are red, there are no edges within $A$, and similarly for $B$. This implies that every edge has one endpoint in $A$ and the other in $B$, which means $G$ is bipartite.

Conversely, suppose $G$ is bipartite, that is, we can partition the vertices into two subsets $V_{1}, V_{2}$ every edge has one endpoint in $V_{1}$ and the other in $V_{2}$. Then coloring every vertex of $V_{1}$ red and every vertex of $V_{2}$ blue yields a valid coloring, so $G$ is 2-colorable.

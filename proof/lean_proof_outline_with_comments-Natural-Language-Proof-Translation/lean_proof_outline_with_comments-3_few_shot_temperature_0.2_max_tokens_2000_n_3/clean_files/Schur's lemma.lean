Power Set is Closed under Intersection
Let $S$ be a set.

Let $\powerset S$ be the power set of $S$.


Then:
:$\forall A, B \in \powerset S: A \cap B \in \powerset S$
`proof`
Let $A, B \in \powerset S$.

Then by the definition of power set, $A \subseteq S$ and $B \subseteq S$.

From Intersection is Subset we have that $A \cap B \subseteq A$.

It follows from Subset Relation is Transitive that $A \cap B \subseteq S$.

Thus $A \cap B \in \powerset S$ and closure is proved.

Square of Sum
 :$\forall x, y \in \R: \paren {x + y}^2 = x^2 + 2 x y + y^2$
`proof`
Follows from the distribution of multiplication over addition:

{{eqn | l = \left({x + y}\right)^2
      | r = \left({x + y}\right) \cdot \left({x + y}\right)

{{eqn | r = x \cdot x + x \cdot y + y \cdot x + y \cdot y
      | c = Real Multiplication Distributes over Addition

Identity of Group is Unique
Let $\struct {G, \circ}$ be a group. Then there is a unique identity element $e \in G$.
`proof`
From Group has Latin Square Property, there exists a unique $x \in G$ such that:
:$a x = b$

and there exists a unique $y \in G$ such that:
:$y a = b$

Setting $b = a$, this becomes:

There exists a unique $x \in G$ such that:
:$a x = a$

and there exists a unique $y \in G$ such that:
:$y a = a$

These $x$ and $y$ are both $e$, by definition of identity element.

Schur's lemma
Let $V$ and $W$ be vector spaces; and let $\rho_{V}$ and $\rho_{W}$ be irreducible representations of $G$ on $V$ and $W$ respectively. If $V$ and $W$ are not isomorphic, then there are no nontrivial representations of $G$ on $V$ and $W$ respectively.
`proof`
Suppose $f$ is a nonzero $G$-linear map from $V$ to $W$. We will prove that $V$ and $W$ are isomorphic. Let $V^{\prime}$ be the kernel, or null space, of $f$ in $V$, the subspace of all $x$ in $V$ for which $f x=0$. (It is easy to check that this is a subspace.) By the assumption that $f$ is $G$-linear, for every $g$ in $G$ and choice of $x$ in $V^{\prime}, f\left(\left(\rho_V(g)\right)(x)\right)=\left(\rho_W(g)\right)(f(x))=\left(\rho_W(g)\right)(0)=0$. But saying that $f\left(\rho_V(g)(x)\right)=0$ is the same as saying that $\rho_V(g)(x)$ is in the null space of $f: V \rightarrow W$. So $V^{\prime}$ is stable under the action of $G$; it is a subrepresentation. Since by assumption $V$ is irreducible, $V^{\prime}$ must be zero; so $f$ is injective.

By an identical argument we will show $f$ is also surjective; since $f\left(\left(\rho_V(g)\right)(x)\right)=\left(\rho_W(g)\right)(f(x))$, we can conclude that for arbitrary choice of $f(x)$ in the image of $f, \rho_W(g)$ sends $f(x)$ somewhere else in the image of $f$; in particular it sends it to the image of $\rho_V(g) x$. So the image of $f(x)$ is a subspace $W^{\prime}$ of $W$ stable under the action of $G$, so it is a subrepresentation and $f$ must be zero or surjective. By assumption it is not zero, so it is surjective, in which case it is an isomorphism.

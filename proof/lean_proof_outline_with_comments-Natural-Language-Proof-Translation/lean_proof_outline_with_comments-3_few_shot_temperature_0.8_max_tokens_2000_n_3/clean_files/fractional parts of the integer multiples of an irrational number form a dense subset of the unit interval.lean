Power Set is Closed under Intersection
Let $S$ be a set.

Let $\powerset S$ be the power set of $S$.


Then:
:$\forall A, B \in \powerset S: A \cap B \in \powerset S$
`proof`
Let $A, B \in \powerset S$.

Then by the definition of power set, $A \subseteq S$ and $B \subseteq S$.

From Intersection is Subset we have that $A \cap B \subseteq A$.

It follows from Subset Relation is Transitive that $A \cap B \subseteq S$.

Thus $A \cap B \in \powerset S$ and closure is proved.

Square of Sum
 :$\forall x, y \in \R: \paren {x + y}^2 = x^2 + 2 x y + y^2$

Follows from the distribution of multiplication over addition:

{{eqn | l = \left({x + y}\right)^2
      | r = \left({x + y}\right) \cdot \left({x + y}\right)

Identity of Group is Unique
Let $\struct {G, \circ}$ be a group. Then there is a unique identity element $e \in G$.
`proof`
From Group has Latin Square Property, there exists a unique $x \in G$ such that:
:$a x = b$

and there exists a unique $y \in G$ such that:
:$y a = b$

Setting $b = a$, this becomes:

There exists a unique $x \in G$ such that:
:$a x = a$

and there exists a unique $y \in G$ such that:
:$y a = a$

These $x$ and $y$ are both $e$, by definition of identity element.

/--`theorem`
Density of irrational orbit
The fractional parts of the integer multiples of an irrational number form a dense subset of the unit interval
`proof`
Let $\alpha$ be an irrational number. Then for distinct $i, j \in \mathbb{Z}$, we must have $\{i \alpha\} \neq\{j \alpha\}$. If this were not true, then
$$
i \alpha-\lfloor i \alpha\rfloor=\{i \alpha\}=\{j \alpha\}=j \alpha-\lfloor j \alpha\rfloor,
$$
which yields the false statement $\alpha=\frac{\lfloor i \alpha\rfloor-\lfloor j \alpha\rfloor}{i-j} \in \mathbb{Q}$. Hence,
$$
S:=\{\{i \alpha\} \mid i \in \mathbb{Z}\}
$$
is an infinite subset of $\left[0,1\right]$.

By the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, $S$ has a limit point in $[0, 1]$. One can thus find pairs of elements of $S$ that are arbitrarily close. Since (the absolute value of) the difference of any two elements of $S$ is also an element of $S$, it follows that $0$ is a limit point of $S$.

To show that $S$ is dense in $[0, 1]$, consider $y \in[0,1]$, and $\epsilon>0$. Then by selecting $x \in S$ such that $\{x\}<\epsilon$ (which exists as $0$ is a limit point), and $N$ such that $N \cdot\{x\} \leq y<(N+1) \cdot\{x\}$, we get: $|y-\{N x\}|<\epsilon$.

Because the irrational numbers are dense in the reals, it follows that the set of all irrational numbers has measure 1. Moreover, the set of rational numbers (which is countable) has measure zero. Hence, the Lebesgue measure of the real numbers not of measure zero, one, or infinity. This also implies that the real numbers are not a Haar measure space, which is a measure space in which all non-empty open sets have measure 0, 1 or ∞.

theorem irrational_orbit_dense : sorry

/--`theorem`
Irrational number
If a number is irrational, then its fractional part is not rational, and vice versa.
`proof`
A rational number can be written in the form
$$ p / q$$
where $p$ and $q$ are integers and $q \neq 0$.

Then, 
$$
\{p / q\} = p / q-\lfloor p / q\rfloor=\frac{p}{q}-\frac{\lfloor p \rfloor}{q} \in \mathbb{Q}.
$$

For an irrational number $α$, assume that $\{α\}$ is rational. Then there exist integers $p$ and $q$ such that
$$
\{α\}=\frac{p}{q},
$$
with $q \neq 0$. By rewriting $α$ as
$$
α=\lfloor α\rfloor+\left\{α\right\}=\lfloor α\rfloor+\frac{p}{q},
$$
we get that $α$ is rational. This would be in contradiction with assuming that $α$ is irrational.

Power Set is Closed under Intersection
Let $S$ be a set.

Let $\powerset S$ be the power set of $S$.


Then:
:$\forall A, B \in \powerset S: A \cap B \in \powerset S$
`proof`
Let $A, B \in \powerset S$.

Then by the definition of power set, $A \subseteq S$ and $B \subseteq S$.

From Intersection is Subset we have that $A \cap B \subseteq A$.

It follows from Subset Relation is Transitive that $A \cap B \subseteq S$.

Thus $A \cap B \in \powerset S$ and closure is proved.

Square of Sum
 :$\forall x, y \in \R: \paren {x + y}^2 = x^2 + 2 x y + y^2$
`proof`
Follows from the distribution of multiplication over addition:

{{begin-eqn}}
{{eqn | l = \left({x + y}\right)^2
      | r = \left({x + y}\right) \cdot \left({x + y}\right)
}}
{{eqn | r = x \cdot \left({x + y}\right) + y \cdot \left({x + y}\right)
      | c = Real Multiplication Distributes over Addition
}}
{{eqn | r = x \cdot x + x \cdot y + y \cdot x + y \cdot y
      | c = Real Multiplication Distributes over Addition
}}
{{eqn | r = x^2 + 2xy + y^2
      | c =

/--`theorem`
Identity of Group is Unique
Let $\struct {G, \circ}$ be a group. Then there is a unique identity element $e \in G$.
`proof`
From Group has Latin Square Property, there exists a unique $x \in G$ such that:
:$a x = b$

and there exists a unique $y \in G$ such that:
:$y a = b$

Setting $b = a$, this becomes:

There exists a unique $x \in G$ such that:
:$a x = a$

and there exists a unique $y \in G$ such that:
:$y a = a$

These $x$ and $y$ are both $e$, by definition of identity element.

/--`theorem`
Overflow theorem
Let $F$ be a set of first-order formulas which has finite models of arbitrarily large size.

Then $F$ has an infinite model.
`proof`
For each $n$, let $\mathbf A_n$ be the formula:

$\exists x_1 \exists x_2 \ldots \exists x_n: \{x_1 \ne x_2 \land x_1 \ne x_3 \land \ldots \land x_{n - 1} \ne x_n\}$

Then $\mathbf A_i$ is true in a structure $\AA$ iff $\AA$ has at least $n$ elements.

Take:
$$ \Gamma := F \cup \bigcup_{i \mathop = 1}^\infty A_i $$

Since $F$ has models of arbitrarily large size, every finite subset of $\Gamma$ is satisfiable.

From the Compactness Theorem, $\Gamma$ is satisfiable in some model $\mathbf{M}$.

But since $\mathbf{M} \models A_i$ for each $i$, $\mathbf{M}$ must be infinite.

So $F$ has an infinite model.

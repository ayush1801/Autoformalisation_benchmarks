Power Set is Closed under Intersection
Let $S$ be a set.

Let $\powerset S$ be the power set of $S$.


Then:
:$\forall A, B \in \powerset S: A \cap B \in \powerset S$
`proof`
Let $A, B \in \powerset S$.

Then by the definition of power set, $A \subseteq S$ and $B \subseteq S$.

From Intersection is Subset we have that $A \cap B \subseteq A$.

It follows from Subset Relation is Transitive that $A \cap B \subseteq S$.

Thus $A \cap B \in \powerset S$ and closure is proved.

Identity of Group is Unique
Let $\struct {G, \circ}$ be a group. Then there is a unique identity element $e \in G$.
`proof`
From Group has Latin Square Property, there exists a unique $x \in G$ such that:
:$a x = b$

and there exists a unique $y \in G$ such that:
:$y a = b$

Setting $b = a$, this becomes:

There exists a unique $x \in G$ such that:
:$a x = a$

and there exists a unique $y \in G$ such that:
:$y a = a$

These $x$ and $y$ are both $e$, by definition of identity element.

Nesbitt's inequality
Let $a$, $b$ and $c$ be positive real numbers.

Then:
:$\dfrac a {b + c} + \dfrac b {a + c} + \dfrac c {a + b} \ge \dfrac 3 2$

      | r = \frac 9 2
      | c = by adding $3$

      | o = \ge
      | r = \frac {9 \paren {a + b + c} } {\paren {b + c} + \paren {a + c} + \paren {a + b} }
      | c = as $\dfrac {a + b + c} {\paren {b + c} + \paren {a + c} + \paren {a + b} } = \dfrac 1 2$
}}
{{eqn | ll= \leadstoandfrom
      | l = \frac {\frac 1 {b + c} + \frac 1 {a + c} + \frac 1 {a + b} } 3
      | o = \ge
      | r = \frac 3 {\paren {b + c} + \paren {a + c} + \paren {a + b} }
      | c = dividing by $3 \paren {a + b + c}$
}}
{{end-eqn}}
These are the arithmetic mean and the harmonic mean of $\dfrac 1 {b + c}$, $\dfrac 1 {a + c}$ and $\dfrac 1 {a + b}$.

From Arithmetic Mean is Never Less than Harmonic Mean the last inequality is true.

Thus Nesbitt's Inequality holds.

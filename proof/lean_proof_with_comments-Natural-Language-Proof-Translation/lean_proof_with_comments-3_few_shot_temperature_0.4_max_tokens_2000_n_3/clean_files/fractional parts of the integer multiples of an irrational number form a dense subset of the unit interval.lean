Power Set is Closed under Intersection
Let $S$ be a set.

Let $\powerset S$ be the power set of $S$.


Then:
:$\forall A, B \in \powerset S: A \cap B \in \powerset S$
`proof`
Let $A, B \in \powerset S$.

Then by the definition of power set, $A \subseteq S$ and $B \subseteq S$.

From Intersection is Subset we have that $A \cap B \subseteq A$.

It follows from Subset Relation is Transitive that $A \cap B \subseteq S$.

Thus $A \cap B \in \powerset S$ and closure is proved.

Square of Sum
 :$\forall x, y \in \R: \paren {x + y}^2 = x^2 + 2 x y + y^2$

Follows from the distribution of multiplication over addition:

{{eqn | l = \left({x + y}\right)^2
      | r = \left({x + y}\right) \cdot \left({x + y}\right)

Identity of Group is Unique
Let $\struct {G, \circ}$ be a group. Then there is a unique identity element $e \in G$.
`proof`
From Group has Latin Square Property, there exists a unique $x \in G$ such that:
:$a x = b$

and there exists a unique $y \in G$ such that:
:$y a = b$

Setting $b = a$, this becomes:

There exists a unique $x \in G$ such that:
:$a x = a$

and there exists a unique $y \in G$ such that:
:$y a = a$

These $x$ and $y$ are both $e$, by definition of identity element.

Density of irrational orbit
The fractional parts of the integer multiples of an irrational number form a dense subset of the unit interval
`proof`
Let $\alpha$ be an irrational number. Then for distinct $i, j \in \mathbb{Z}$, we must have $\{i \alpha\} \neq\{j \alpha\}$. If this were not true, then
$$
i \alpha-\lfloor i \alpha\rfloor=\{i \alpha\}=\{j \alpha\}=j \alpha-\lfloor j \alpha\rfloor,
$$
which yields the false statement $\alpha=\frac{\lfloor i \alpha\rfloor-\lfloor j \alpha\rfloor}{i-j} \in \mathbb{Q}$. Hence,
$$
S:=\{\{i \alpha\} \mid i \in \mathbb{Z}\}
$$
is an infinite subset of $\left[0,1\right]$.

By the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, $S$ has a limit point in $[0, 1]$. One can thus find pairs of elements of $S$ that are arbitrarily close. Since (the absolute value of) the difference of any two elements of $S$ is also an element of $S$, it follows that $0$ is a limit point of $S$.

To show that $S$ is dense in $[0, 1]$, consider $y \in[0,1]$, and $\epsilon>0$. Then by selecting $x \in S$ such that $\{x\}<\epsilon$ (which exists as $0$ is a limit point), and $N$ such that $N \cdot\{x\} \leq y<(N+1) \cdot\{x\}$, we get: $|y-\{N x\}|<\epsilon$.

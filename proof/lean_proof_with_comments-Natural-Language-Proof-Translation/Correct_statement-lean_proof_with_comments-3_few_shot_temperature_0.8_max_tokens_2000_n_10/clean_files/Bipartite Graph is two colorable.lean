Power Set is Closed under Intersection
Let $S$ be a set.

Let $\powerset S$ be the power set of $S$.


Then:
:$\forall A, B \in \powerset S: A \cap B \in \powerset S$
`proof`
Let $A, B \in \powerset S$.

Then by the definition of power set, $A \subseteq S$ and $B \subseteq S$.

From Intersection is Subset we have that $A \cap B \subseteq A$.

It follows from Subset Relation is Transitive that $A \cap B \subseteq S$.

Thus $A \cap B \in \powerset S$ and closure is proved.

Follows from the distribution of multiplication over addition:

/--`theorem`
Identity of Group is Unique
Let $\struct {G, \circ}$ be a group. Then there is a unique identity element $e \in G$.
`proof`
From Group has Latin Square Property, there exists a unique $x \in G$ such that:
:$a x = b$

and there exists a unique $y \in G$ such that:
:$y a = b$

Setting $b = a$, this becomes:

There exists a unique $x \in G$ such that:
:$a x = a$

and there exists a unique $y \in G$ such that:
:$y a = a$

These $x$ and $y$ are both $e$, by definition of identity element.

/--`theorem`
Bipartite Graph is two colorable
Let $G$ be a graph. Then $G$ is 2-colorable if and only if $G$ is bipartite.
`proof`
Let $G$ be a 2-colorable graph, which means we can color every vertex either red or blue, and no edge will have both endpoints colored the same color. Let $A$ denote the subset of vertices colored red, and let $B$ denote the subset of vertices colored blue. Since all vertices of $A$ are red, there are no edges within $A$, and similarly for $B$. This implies that every edge has one endpoint in $A$ and the other in $B$, which means $G$ is bipartite.

Conversely, suppose $G$ is bipartite, that is, we can partition the vertices into two subsets $V_{1}, V_{2}$ every edge has one endpoint in $V_{1}$ and the other in $V_{2}$. Then coloring every vertex of $V_{1}$ red and every vertex of $V_{2}$ blue yields a valid coloring, so $G$ is 2-colorable.

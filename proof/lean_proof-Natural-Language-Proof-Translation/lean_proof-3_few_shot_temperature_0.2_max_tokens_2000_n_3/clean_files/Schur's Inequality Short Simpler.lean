Power Set is Closed under Intersection
Let $S$ be a set.

Let $\powerset S$ be the power set of $S$.


Then:
:$\forall A, B \in \powerset S: A \cap B \in \powerset S$
`proof`
Let $A, B \in \powerset S$.

Then by the definition of power set, $A \subseteq S$ and $B \subseteq S$.

From Intersection is Subset we have that $A \cap B \subseteq A$.

It follows from Subset Relation is Transitive that $A \cap B \subseteq S$.

Thus $A \cap B \in \powerset S$ and closure is proved.

Square of Sum
 :$\forall x, y \in \R: \paren {x + y}^2 = x^2 + 2 x y + y^2$

/--`theorem`
Identity of Group is Unique
Let $\struct {G, \circ}$ be a group. Then there is a unique identity element $e \in G$.
`proof`
From Group has Latin Square Property, there exists a unique $x \in G$ such that:
:$a x = b$

and there exists a unique $y \in G$ such that:
:$y a = b$

Setting $b = a$, this becomes:

There exists a unique $x \in G$ such that:
:$a x = a$

and there exists a unique $y \in G$ such that:
:$y a = a$

These $x$ and $y$ are both $e$, by definition of identity element.

Schur's Inequality Short Simpler
Let $x, y, z \in \R_{\ge 0}$ be positive real numbers such that $x \ge y \ge z \ge 0$.

Let $t \in \R, t > 0$ be a (strictly) positive real number.


Then:
:$x^t \paren {x - y} \paren {x - z} + y^t \paren {y - z} \paren {y - x} + z^t \paren {z - x} \paren {z - y} \ge 0$

`proof`

Consider the expression:
:$\paren {x - y} \paren {x^t \paren {x - z} - y^t \paren {y - z}} + z^t \paren {x - z} \paren {y - z}$


We see that every term in the above is non-negative. So, directly:
:$(1): \quad \paren {x - y} \paren {x^t \paren {x - z} - y^t \paren {y - z}} + z^t \paren {x - z} \paren {y - z} \ge 0$

$(1) can be rearranged to Schur's inequality.

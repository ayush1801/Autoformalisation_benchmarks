Power Set is Closed under Intersection
Let $S$ be a set.

Let $\powerset S$ be the power set of $S$.


Then:
:$\forall A, B \in \powerset S: A \cap B \in \powerset S$
`proof`
Let $A, B \in \powerset S$.

Then by the definition of power set, $A \subseteq S$ and $B \subseteq S$.

From Intersection is Subset we have that $A \cap B \subseteq A$.

It follows from Subset Relation is Transitive that $A \cap B \subseteq S$.

Thus $A \cap B \in \powerset S$ and closure is proved.

Square of Sum
 :$\forall x, y \in \R: \paren {x + y}^2 = x^2 + 2 x y + y^2$

Follows from the distribution of multiplication over addition:

{{eqn | l = \left({x + y}\right)^2
      | r = \left({x + y}\right) \cdot \left({x + y}\right)

Identity of Group is Unique
Let $\struct {G, \circ}$ be a group. Then there is a unique identity element $e \in G$.
`proof`
From Group has Latin Square Property, there exists a unique $x \in G$ such that:
:$a x = b$

and there exists a unique $y \in G$ such that:
:$y a = b$

Setting $b = a$, this becomes:

There exists a unique $x \in G$ such that:
:$a x = a$

and there exists a unique $y \in G$ such that:
:$y a = a$

These $x$ and $y$ are both $e$, by definition of identity element.

Contraction mapping theorem
Let $B$ be a Banach space, $M$ a closed subset of $B$, and $\Phi$ a mapping from $M$ to $M$ such that for some $k \in[0,1)$,

$$ \|\Phi(x)-\Phi(y)\| \leq k\|x-y\| $$

for any two points $x$ and $y$ in $M$. Then there is a unique point $z$ in $M$ such that $\Phi(z)=z$.
`proof`
Choose some $x_{0}$ in $M$. Define a sequence $\left\{x_{i}\right\}$ by setting $x_{i+1}=\Phi\left(x_{i}\right)$, for $i \in \mathbb{N}$. Then for any $n$,
$$ x_{n}=x_{0}+\left(x_{1}-x_{0}\right)+\left(x_{2}-x_{1}\right)+\cdots+\left(x_{n}-x_{n-1}\right) $$

Also, for $i \geq 1$

$$ \left\|x_{i+1}-x_{i}\right\| \leq k\left\|x_{i}-x_{i-1}\right\| \text {, } $$

and by induction we easily show that

$$ \left\|x_{i+1}-x_{i}\right\| \leq k^{i}\left\|x_{1}-x_{0}\right\| $$

Because $|k|<1, \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} k^{i}$ converges, which implies that $\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\left\|x_{i+1}-x_{i}\right\|$ converges. By the Weirerstrass M test, $\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\left(x_{i+1}-x_{i}\right)$ converges in $B$, and hence $\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} x_{n}$ exists. Let $z$ be this limit. Since $M$ is closed and $x_{n} \in M$ for each $n, z \in M$. Also, $x_{n+1}=\Phi\left(x_{n}\right)$, and so (from the definition of limit)

$$ \lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \Phi\left(x_{n}\right)=\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} x_{n+1}=z $$

Further, for any $n$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\|\Phi(z)-z\| &=\left\|\Phi(z)-\Phi\left(x_{n}\right)+\Phi\left(x_{n}\right)-z\right\| \\
& \leq k\left\|z-x_{n}\right\|+\left\|\Phi\left(x_{n}\right)-z\right\|
\end{aligned}
$$

Since the limit of the right side as $n \rightarrow \infty$ is zero, and the left side is independent of $n$, it follows that the left side is zero for every $n$, and so $z$ is a fixed point for $\Phi$.

To prove uniqueness, suppose that there are two fixed points, say $x$ and $y$. Then
$$ f(x)=x, f(y)=y $$
and so
$$ |x-y|=|f(x)-f(y)| \leq k|x-y| $$

where $0<k<1$. This is only possible if $x=y$.

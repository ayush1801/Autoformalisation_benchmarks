Power Set is Closed under Intersection
Let $S$ be a set.

Let $\powerset S$ be the power set of $S$.


Then:
:$\forall A, B \in \powerset S: A \cap B \in \powerset S$
`proof`
Let $A, B \in \powerset S$.

Then by the definition of power set, $A \subseteq S$ and $B \subseteq S$.

From Intersection is Subset we have that $A \cap B \subseteq A$.

It follows from Subset Relation is Transitive that $A \cap B \subseteq S$.

Thus $A \cap B \in \powerset S$ and closure is proved.

Square of Sum
 :$\forall x, y \in \R: \paren {x + y}^2 = x^2 + 2 x y + y^2$
`proof`
Follows from the distribution of multiplication over addition:

{{begin-eqn}}
{{eqn | l = \left({x + y}\right)^2
      | r = \left({x + y}\right) \cdot \left({x + y}\right)
}}
{{eqn | r = x \cdot \left({x + y}\right) + y \cdot \left({x + y}\right)
      | c = Real Multiplication Distributes over Addition
}}
{{eqn | r = x \cdot x + x \cdot y + y \cdot x + y \cdot y
      | c = Real Multiplication Distributes over Addition
}}
{{eqn | r = x^2 + 2xy + y^2
      | c = 
}}

/--`theorem`
Identity of Group is Unique
Let $\struct {G, \circ}$ be a group. Then there is a unique identity element $e \in G$.
`proof`
From Group has Latin Square Property, there exists a unique $x \in G$ such that:
:$a x = b$

and there exists a unique $y \in G$ such that:
:$y a = b$

Setting $b = a$, this becomes:

There exists a unique $x \in G$ such that:
:$a x = a$

and there exists a unique $y \in G$ such that:
:$y a = a$

These $x$ and $y$ are both $e$, by definition of identity element.

/--`theorem`
fractional parts of the integer multiples of an irrational number form a dense subset of the unit interval
Let $G_1$ and $G_2$ be finite abelian groups. For a homomorphism $f: G_1 \rightarrow G_2$, set $f^*: \widehat{G}_2 \rightarrow \widehat{G}_1$ by $f^*(\chi)=\chi \circ f$. Then $f^*$ is a group homomorphism and the map sending $f$ to $f^*$ gives a group isomorphism
$$
\operatorname{Hom}\left(G_1, G_2\right) \cong \operatorname{Hom}\left(\widehat{G}_2, \widehat{G}_1\right) .
$$

Here $\operatorname{Hom}\left(G_1, G_2\right)$ is the set of all homomorphisms from the abelian group $G_1$ to the abelian group $G_2$ which forms an abelian group under pointwise multiplication.
`proof`
Let $\alpha$ be an irrational number. Then for distinct $i, j \in \mathbb{Z}$, we must have $\{i \alpha\} \neq\{j \alpha\}$. If this were not true, then
$$
i \alpha-\lfloor i \alpha\rfloor=\{i \alpha\}=\{j \alpha\}=j \alpha-\lfloor j \alpha\rfloor,
$$
which yields the false statement $\alpha=\frac{\lfloor i \alpha\rfloor-\lfloor j \alpha\rfloor}{i-j} \in \mathbb{Q}$. Hence,
$$
S:=\{\{i \alpha\} \mid i \in \mathbb{Z}\}
$$
is an infinite subset of $\left[0,1\right]$.

By the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, $S$ has a limit point in $[0, 1]$. One can thus find pairs of elements of $S$ that are arbitrarily close. Since (the absolute value of) the difference of any two elements of $S$ is also an element of $S$, it follows that $0$ is a limit point of $S$.

To show that $S$ is dense in $[0, 1]$, consider $y \in[0,1]$, and $\epsilon>0$. Then by selecting $x \in S$ such that $\{x\}<\epsilon$ (which exists as $0$ is a limit point), and $N$ such that $N \cdot\{x\} \leq y<(N+1) \cdot\{x\}$, we get: $|y-\{N x\}|<\epsilon$.

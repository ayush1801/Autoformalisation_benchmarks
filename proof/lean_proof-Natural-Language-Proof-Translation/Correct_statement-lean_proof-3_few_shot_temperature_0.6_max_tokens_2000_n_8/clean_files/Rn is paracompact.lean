Power Set is Closed under Intersection
Let $S$ be a set.

Let $\powerset S$ be the power set of $S$.


Then:
:$\forall A, B \in \powerset S: A \cap B \in \powerset S$
`proof`
Let $A, B \in \powerset S$.

Then by the definition of power set, $A \subseteq S$ and $B \subseteq S$.

From Intersection is Subset we have that $A \cap B \subseteq A$.

It follows from Subset Relation is Transitive that $A \cap B \subseteq S$.

Thus $A \cap B \in \powerset S$ and closure is proved.

Identity of Group is Unique
Let $\struct {G, \circ}$ be a group. Then there is a unique identity element $e \in G$.
`proof`
From Group has Latin Square Property, there exists a unique $x \in G$ such that:
:$a x = b$

and there exists a unique $y \in G$ such that:
:$y a = b$

Setting $b = a$, this becomes:

There exists a unique $x \in G$ such that:
:$a x = a$

and there exists a unique $y \in G$ such that:
:$y a = a$

These $x$ and $y$ are both $e$, by definition of identity element.

/--`theorem`
\mathbb{R}^n is paracompact
$\mathbb{R}^n$ is paracompact for all $n$.
`proof`
Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an open covering of $\mathbb{R}^n$. We now construct a locally finite open refinement $\mathcal{C}$ of $\mathcal{A}$ that covers $\mathbb{R}^n$. First, we define a collection of pen balls. Let $B_0 = \phi$, and for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, let $B_m$ denote the ball of radius $m$
centered at 0. Given $m$, set $\Bar{B_m}$ is compact in $\mathbb{R}^n$ by the Heine-Borel theorem, so choose finitely many elements of $\mathcal{A}$ that cover $\Bar{B_m}$ and intersect each one with the open set $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus \Bar{B_{m - 1}}$, and let $\mathcal{C}_{m}$ denote this collection of open sets (each an open subset of an element of $\mathcal{A}$). So $\mathcal{C} = \bigcup_{m = 0}^{\infty} \mathcal{C}_m$ is an open refinement of $\mathcal{A}$. Note that $\mathcal{C}$ covers $\mathbb{R}^n$ since for any $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$, there is a smallest $m \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $x \in \Bar{B_{m}}$ (namely, some $m$ where $\rVert x \lVert \leq m \leq \rVert x \lVert + 1$), and so $x$ is an element of $\mathcal{C}_m$. Now collection $\mathcal{C}$ is locally finite since for given $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$, neighborhood $B_m$ intersects only finitely many elements of $\mathcal{C}$, namely those elements in collection $\mathcal{C}_1 \cup \mathcal{C}_2 \cup \cdots \mathcal{C}_m$. So $\mathcal{C}$ is a locally finite open refinement of $\mathcal{A}$ that covers $\mathbb{R}^n$, hence $\mathbb{R}^n$ is paracompact.

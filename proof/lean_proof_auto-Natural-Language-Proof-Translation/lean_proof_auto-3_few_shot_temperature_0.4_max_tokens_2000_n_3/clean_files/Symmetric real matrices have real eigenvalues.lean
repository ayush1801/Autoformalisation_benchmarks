Power Set is Closed under Intersection
Let $S$ be a set.

Let $\powerset S$ be the power set of $S$.


Then:
:$\forall A, B \in \powerset S: A \cap B \in \powerset S$
`proof`
Let $A, B \in \powerset S$.

Then by the definition of power set, $A \subseteq S$ and $B \subseteq S$.

From Intersection is Subset we have that $A \cap B \subseteq A$.

It follows from Subset Relation is Transitive that $A \cap B \subseteq S$.

Thus $A \cap B \in \powerset S$ and closure is proved.

Square of Sum

Follows from the distribution of multiplication over addition:

Identity of Group is Unique
Let $\struct {G, \circ}$ be a group. Then there is a unique identity element $e \in G$.
`proof`
From Group has Latin Square Property, there exists a unique $x \in G$ such that:
:$a x = b$

and there exists a unique $y \in G$ such that:
:$y a = b$

Setting $b = a$, this becomes:

There exists a unique $x \in G$ such that:
:$a x = a$

and there exists a unique $y \in G$ such that:
:$y a = a$

These $x$ and $y$ are both $e$, by definition of identity element.

/--`theorem`
Symmetric real matrices have real eigenvalues
Every real symmetric matrix has real eigenvalues.
`proof`
Recall that if $z=a+b i$ is a complex number, its complex conjugate is defined by $\bar{z}=a-b i$. We have $z \bar{z}=(a+b i)(a-b i)=a^{2}+b^{2}$, so $z \bar{z}$ is always a nonnegative real number (and equals 0 only when $z=0$ ). It is also true that if $w, z$ are complex numbers, then $\overline{w z}=\bar{w} \bar{z}$.

With this in mind, suppose that $\lambda$ is a (possibly complex) eigenvalue of the real symmetric matrix $A$. Thus there is a nonzero vector $\mathbf{v}$, also with complex entries, such that $A \mathbf{v}=\lambda \mathbf{v}$. By taking the complex conjugate of both sides, and noting that $\bar{A}=A$ since $A$ has real entries, we get $\overline{A \mathbf{v}}=\overline{\lambda \mathbf{v}} \Rightarrow A \overline{\mathbf{v}}=\bar{\lambda} \overline{\mathbf{v}}$. Then, using that $A^{T}=A$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\overline{\mathbf{v}}^{T} A \mathbf{v}=\overline{\mathbf{v}}^{T}(A \mathbf{v})=\overline{\mathbf{v}}^{T}(\lambda \mathbf{v})=\lambda(\overline{\mathbf{v}} \cdot \mathbf{v}) \\
&\overline{\mathbf{v}}^{T} A \mathbf{v}=(A \overline{\mathbf{v}})^{T} \mathbf{v}=(\bar{\lambda} \overline{\mathbf{v}})^{T} \mathbf{v}=\bar{\lambda}(\overline{\mathbf{v}} \cdot \mathbf{v}) .
\end{aligned}
$$

Since $\mathbf{v} \neq \mathbf{0}$, we have $\overline{\mathbf{v}} \cdot \mathbf{v} \neq 0$. Thus $\lambda=\bar{\lambda}$, which means $\lambda \in \mathbf{R}$
